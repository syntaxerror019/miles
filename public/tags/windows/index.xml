      <description>Although I much prefer Linux, I do need Microsoft Windows for Fusion 360 along with a few other windows-only softwares.&#xA;Fusion 360 will be no longer supporting Windows 10, so I figured an upgrade was in store, however, I was met with some requirement deficiencies according to Microsoft:&#xA;These requirements were instated just for Windows 11, as Windows 10 (and previous versions) still have no mention of these necessities.</description>
