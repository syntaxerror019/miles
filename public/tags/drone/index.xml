      <description>I have been flying FPV drones for nearly 2 years now, and one of the most frequent things to fail on them (besides the props) are LiPo batteries. Often times a couple of good crashes will do a number on a battery. Similarly, forgetting to take the voltage of them down to storage voltage has ruined multiple packs of mine. After testing my collection of &amp;ldquo;bad batteries&amp;rdquo; I realized that many of them only have 1 or 2 cells that seem to be damaged.</description>
