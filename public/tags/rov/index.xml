      <description>This week was a bit funky. Not only did I have limited time in shop, but limited time in school overall!&#xA;Our school had a half-day on Wednesday (we get released at noon) and the day after was a snow day.&#xA;Because of these two things, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a whole lot of time to work on roboticy things.&#xA;This is enough to call a snow day?! Nonetheless, my friends and I ended up getting some work done on the ROV on the days we did have.</description>
