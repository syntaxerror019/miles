      <description>With my new HAM radio license in the books, I bought the Baofeng UV5R as my first HT. Between its low-cost and various features, I think its been a great radio to start out with. With an upgraded antenna (almost not optional) and a larger battery bank, I&amp;rsquo;ve found the radio to be a pretty solid unit. Unfortunately, there is no direct way to plug in the radio&amp;rsquo;s speaker and mic jacks to a computer soundcard to transmit and receive sounds to and from my PC, but with a simple cable modification, this can be done.</description>

      <description>I have been flying FPV drones for nearly 2 years now, and one of the most frequent things to fail on them (besides the props) are LiPo batteries. Often times a couple of good crashes will do a number on a battery. Similarly, forgetting to take the voltage of them down to storage voltage has ruined multiple packs of mine. After testing my collection of &amp;ldquo;bad batteries&amp;rdquo; I realized that many of them only have 1 or 2 cells that seem to be damaged.</description>
