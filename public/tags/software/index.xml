      <title>Upgrade to Windows 11 Even If Your PC is &#34;Unsupported&#34; - Secure Boot is NOT Required!</title>

      <description>Although I much prefer Linux, I do need Microsoft Windows for Fusion 360 along with a few other windows-only softwares.&#xA;Fusion 360 will be no longer supporting Windows 10, so I figured an upgrade was in store, however, I was met with some requirement deficiencies according to Microsoft:&#xA;These requirements were instated just for Windows 11, as Windows 10 (and previous versions) still have no mention of these necessities.</description>

      <title>Robotics &amp; Engineering - Week of 03/31/25</title>

      <description>This week, I made a major software breakthrough on the ROV.&#xA;The IMU will periodically return invalid data, likely due to a faulty sensor. Due to the lack of error handling in the code, the ROV would receive a null value and the enire software system responsible for the control of the ROV would crash and need to be restarted. This bug that I&amp;rsquo;ve been tracking for nearly a month now was resolved by simply implenting some basic catches to detect when these null bits come in, and simply ignore them.</description>

      <description>This week, I worked on the ROV for the robotics team as I had already completed the lightbox project as shown in the previous post. The robot has been experiencing some reliability issues, and they have something to do with the Raspberry Pi 5 we have onboard. The Pi would suddenly &amp;ldquo;crash&amp;rdquo; (meaning a loss of connection over ssh; ethernet port lights turned off; only red power light was illuminated) without warning.</description>

      <title>GUI over SSH with X11</title>

      <description>SSH is awesome, but your options when trying to run a GUI application are a bit limited, especially on headless computers. Luckily there are a few ways to go about handling this problem, even if your computer has no monitor directly connected to it.&#xA;SSH into the machine First of all, you need to ssh into your machine to get everything set up. Now you have a couple options. Some people may have a display (be it a full monitor, a TV screen, a touch display, etc) and others may have nothing it all.</description>

      <description>Introduction Between all the various tutorials online, there is no straight way to installing OpenCV on a RPI&amp;hellip;&#xA;Issue&amp;rsquo;s I have encountered personally include but are not limited to the following:&#xA;Building from source issues Various rare errors Garbage tutorials So in this simple guide, I have documented my installation of OpenCV on my Raspberry Pi, Model 3 B+&#xA;Other models should be quite similar.&#xA;Requirements For this project, I used a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ running Ubuntu Server 20.</description>

      <title>AI Meets the Deep: Our Journey to 3rd Place in the 2024 Exploration Challenge</title>

      <description>With the annual MATE ROV competition all finished up, Sunk Robotics placed 3rd worldwide in terms of robotics, and 9th overall including the marketing and advertising campaigns. A good run indeed. Our robot performed well, although reliability is our priority for next yearâ€™s attempt.&#xA;A New Competition Although MATE ROV offers its well-known underwater competition, there are other events they host as well. This year, Matty Harris and I undertook a secondary challenge, known as the 2024 Ocean Exploration Video Challenge (OER) where teams must create custom Artificial Intelligence models that can be used to identify underwater species from a provided video.</description>
