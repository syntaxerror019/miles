      <description>I have had this cheap 12V switching power supply that (claims) to be able to deliver 30 amps. It is a common power supply type, and are commonly used in consumer applications, especially in the LED lighting industry. In fact, the exact same model can be found mounted on my Creality Ender 3 3D printer.&#xA;Background Personally, I find these power supplies perfect for many use cases, especially when one considers their pricepoint.</description>

      <description>The lightbox has been finished! I designed the acrylic and manufactured it on our laser engraver/cutter. The end result was better than expected, although I had to condense (shorten) the acrylic overall to meet the max acrylic dimensions of 70 square cm.&#xA;After the transparent acrylic was finished, I screwed it into the lightbox and &amp;ldquo;force fit&amp;rdquo; everything together as designed. Luckily my tolerances and dimensions matched perfectly.&#xA;The acrylic had to be custom designed to fit the screw holes and the box geometry.</description>

      <description>We often save paper bags for future uses, but right now our storage solution is less than ideal. Normally they are stored behind the recycling bin, but the big issue with that is when the recycling is moved, all the bags fall over. I then remembered I own a 3D printer and have the ability to do CAD. With that in mind, I sketched up some basic designs to get a concept in place of how I could overcome this issue.</description>
