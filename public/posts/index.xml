      <description>I inherited a LaTraxx (Traxxas) Prerunner RC Car from a friend as a gift to fix. The car would power on and the receiver would connect, allowing the steering servo to move, however the car would not roll. It had been sitting in their basement for years unused, causing the NiMH battery to be extremely discharged. After charging and discharging it repeatedly, I was able to regain sufficient capacity and it worked fine, however I ended up replacing it altogether later on.</description>

      <description>This week, I spent most of shop time working with the golf cart. The new battery arrived so we put it in place, and we gave it a quick test-drive even though not all batteries were balanced yet. We finally charged all batteries and got them to each be within 0.2 volts of each other which will allow us to connect the equalizer modules. Hopefully this will prevent us from ruining another 300 dollar lead acid battery!</description>

      <description>I had less shop-time this week than normal. On Tuesday, my entire Spanish class had to take the AAPL proficiency test, which ended up eating all of my fifth period and over half of my sixth period that would normally have been spent in shop working. On Monday, we were scheduled to take the exam during sixth period, after our health class, but it ultimately ended up getting canceled half-way through.</description>

      <description>This week involved an assortment of work on various projects. With the seniors gone, the entire school felt a lot quieter. Luckily, I inherited one of the best spec. PCs in the shop from one of the seniors which will be great for when I get to working on the golf-cart&amp;rsquo;s AI autonomy system! I&amp;rsquo;m working on dual-booting it with Linux + Windows 11.&#xA;I also printed and installed the new dashboard panel for the golf cart which will display statistics regarding battery level, range, voltage, and alerts.</description>

      <description>We have had a rain barrel attached to our garage roof for over a decade now, but a perennial issue is present. Due to the large cluster of trees and low-hanging branches near the roof of the building, the gutter and downspout often clutter with tree-debris. To combat this, we cut out some screen mesh to fit inside. While this did help, it was unreliable and often got covered in leaves and sticks, making cleaning it a routine procedure.</description>

      <description>This week, I continued working on the Sumo Bot project. I re-printed the frame and milled another PCB, then soldered all the components together. We will be making two robots for the competition. Likely, the bot will be ready to test and debug early next week.&#xA;Although in the process of printing, I noticed that one of the Fusion 3s wasn&amp;rsquo;t working. Will graciously fixed the jammed extruder on the printer, but it was still having unexpected difficulty when homing the Y axis.</description>

      <description>Introduction Today, I will walk you through the creation of a cable for your Anytone AT778 or Retevis RT95 ham radio, enabling you to both send and receive digital modes. This post is very similar to my old one, where I made a digital audio cable for the Baofeng UV5R. Check that out if you have a UV5R. If you want custom cable instructions, feel free to ask.&#xA;This cable will allow you to both RX and TX any digital mode from your laptop, including (but not limited to)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This week, I made a major software breakthrough on the ROV.&#xA;The IMU will periodically return invalid data, likely due to a faulty sensor. Due to the lack of error handling in the code, the ROV would receive a null value and the enire software system responsible for the control of the ROV would crash and need to be restarted. This bug that I&amp;rsquo;ve been tracking for nearly a month now was resolved by simply implenting some basic catches to detect when these null bits come in, and simply ignore them.</description>

      <description>This week, Tim finished his electronics skeleton that he has been working on for the past few weeks. It looks very nice and is completely custom designed, machined, and resin printed. I helped him install it into the ROV, and I can already tell that it will make things significantly easier in terms of debugging and also performance of the overall machine.&#xA;The previous layout consisted of floppy acrylic fingers that held the PCBs in place.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend, two of my friends and I went out foxhunting. On the groups.io page, we found a few local foxes that had been set up. We took the opportunity to drive 30 minutes North to see what we could find!&#xA;Since we all got our radio licenses around the same time, we all purchased the same, budget-friendly HT: the Baofeng UV-5R. We brought along for with us for the endeavor, and an assortment of various antennas- from long whips to little stubbies.</description>

      <description>The first 2 days of shop this week were spent replacing XT30 connectors on the ROV&amp;rsquo;s power distribution board. There have been connection issues in the past, and I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want this to factor into existing reliability issues.&#xA;On Wednesday, Jonas Wirz and I got the ROV into the pool, however, we had some free time before then and were very productive with it.&#xA;Short-lived gated off area exploration (right).</description>

      <description>When I bought an upgrade from my baofeng UV5R (ANYTONE AT-778UV), I figured a new antenna set-up was in store.&#xA;My base station antenna is a Diamond X50, attached to a custom mast.&#xA;This setup was a heck of a lot better than the rubber duck on my handheld, but because it was only about 8ft. from the ground, the environment and houses nearby would block both TX and RX signals significantly.</description>

      <description>This week I locked in and spent a good chunk of time identifying the reasoning behind the mysterious crashing phenomenon we have been experiencing for over a year and a half in the ROV.&#xA;Raspberry Pi 5 Problems In the past, the main control computer (RPi 5) was experiencing power interruption issues due to the massive current draw of the 8 thrusters. Because of the low dropout voltage in the 5 volt regulator, we found that adding some capacitange along these output lines helped smooth out any wild ripples.</description>

      <description>This week was a bit funky. Not only did I have limited time in shop, but limited time in school overall!&#xA;Our school had a half-day on Wednesday (we get released at noon) and the day after was a snow day.&#xA;Because of these two things, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a whole lot of time to work on roboticy things.&#xA;This is enough to call a snow day?! Nonetheless, my friends and I ended up getting some work done on the ROV on the days we did have.</description>

      <description>This week consisted of a combination of activities both during shop-time and during robotics club. I spent the majority of my shop time helping my classmates with their light boxes. This included anything from crimping connectors to soldering small parts onto PCBs. I also spent some time optimizing the ROV in terms of performance and reliability, which included setting up a systemd service to automatically start the main ROV software.</description>

      <description>This week, I worked on the ROV for the robotics team as I had already completed the lightbox project as shown in the previous post. The robot has been experiencing some reliability issues, and they have something to do with the Raspberry Pi 5 we have onboard. The Pi would suddenly &amp;ldquo;crash&amp;rdquo; (meaning a loss of connection over ssh; ethernet port lights turned off; only red power light was illuminated) without warning.</description>

      <description>I have had this cheap 12V switching power supply that (claims) to be able to deliver 30 amps. It is a common power supply type, and are commonly used in consumer applications, especially in the LED lighting industry. In fact, the exact same model can be found mounted on my Creality Ender 3 3D printer.&#xA;Background Personally, I find these power supplies perfect for many use cases, especially when one considers their pricepoint.</description>

      <description>The lightbox has been finished! I designed the acrylic and manufactured it on our laser engraver/cutter. The end result was better than expected, although I had to condense (shorten) the acrylic overall to meet the max acrylic dimensions of 70 square cm.&#xA;After the transparent acrylic was finished, I screwed it into the lightbox and &amp;ldquo;force fit&amp;rdquo; everything together as designed. Luckily my tolerances and dimensions matched perfectly.&#xA;The acrylic had to be custom designed to fit the screw holes and the box geometry.</description>

      <description>While in robotics this week, I continued my work on the lightbox project. This week involved a lot of CAD and 3D printing for me, and ended up taking a bit more time than expected. Generally speaking, I am ahead of schedule so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry too much.&#xA;The light box is composed of two main parts that get 3D printed and screwed together. There is the base which is the outer shell and holds the button and power jack.</description>

      <description>SSH is awesome, but your options when trying to run a GUI application are a bit limited, especially on headless computers. Luckily there are a few ways to go about handling this problem, even if your computer has no monitor directly connected to it.&#xA;SSH into the machine First of all, you need to ssh into your machine to get everything set up. Now you have a couple options. Some people may have a display (be it a full monitor, a TV screen, a touch display, etc) and others may have nothing it all.</description>

      <description>Paper bags are great. They are much more sustainable than their plastic counterparts and they are reusable and recyclable. I often keep or collect these bags because they have so many uses.&#xA;The issue I have is that I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good place to put them. At the moment, they are stored behind my recycling bin, being propped up. When I take out the recycling they all fall down and make a mess.</description>

      <description>During my time in the Robotics Shop 5th and 6th period this week, I made significant headway on the lightbox project. For my lightbox, I will be making a transparent &amp;ldquo;EXIT&amp;rdquo; sign that you frequently see in modern office buildings. These signs are very expensive and can be found online for hundreds of dollars. My plan is to make it for much less. The most expensive component to the project would be the acrylic, which can be found for about 10 dollars for an appropriate size.</description>

      <description>With my new HAM radio license in the books, I bought the Baofeng UV5R as my first HT. Between its low-cost and various features, I think its been a great radio to start out with. With an upgraded antenna (almost not optional) and a larger battery bank, I&amp;rsquo;ve found the radio to be a pretty solid unit. Unfortunately, there is no direct way to plug in the radio&amp;rsquo;s speaker and mic jacks to a computer soundcard to transmit and receive sounds to and from my PC, but with a simple cable modification, this can be done.</description>

A good run indeed. Our robot performed well, although reliability is our priority for next year’s attempt.&#xA;A New Competition Although MATE ROV offers its well-known underwater competition, there are other events they host as well. This year, Matty Harris and I undertook a secondary challenge, known as the 2024 Ocean Exploration Video Challenge (OER) where teams must create custom Artificial Intelligence models that can be used to identify underwater species from a provided video.</description>
