This week, Tim finished his electronics skeleton that he has been working on for the past few weeks. It looks very nice and is completely custom designed, machined, and resin printed. I helped him install it into the ROV, and I can already tell that it will make things significantly easier in terms of debugging and also performance of the overall machine. 

The previous layout consisted of floppy acrylic fingers that held the PCBs in place. The boards never layed straight nor stayed that way when moved or jostled.

To effectively install it, we took the entire electronics system out of the ROV. I took that as an opportunity to remake some of the sketchy cables that were responsible for the control, and also label the various ports that look the same but serve different purposes.
