I have been flying FPV drones for nearly 2 years now, and one of the most frequent things to fail on them (besides the props) are LiPo batteries. Often times a couple of good crashes will do a number on a battery. Similarly, forgetting to take the voltage of them down to storage voltage has ruined multiple packs of mine. After testing my collection of "bad batteries" I realized that many of them only have 1 or 2 cells that seem to be damaged. Because I fly with 4s (4 cell) drone batteries, if one cell inside breaks, the whole battery becomes useless. The other cells are often times perfectly functional. 

**Disclaimer:** Lithium batteries can be dangerous if mishandled and/ or mistreated. Please only follow this guide as an educational reference, as I do not take any responsibility if something were to go awry.
