We often save paper bags for future uses, but right now our storage solution is less than ideal. Normally they are stored behind the recycling bin, but the big issue with that is when the recycling is moved, all the bags fall over. I then remembered I own a 3D printer and have the ability to do CAD. With that in mind, I sketched up some basic designs to get a concept in place of how I could overcome this issue.

<div>
<br><img onclick="window.location.href=this.src;" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 30%;" src="/posts/diy-bag-holder/sketch.png"/></img><br>    
</div>

After a few minutes of refining the design, I moved over to the computer to design it in full.

<div>
<br><img onclick="window.location.href=this.src;" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 30%;" src="/posts/diy-bag-holder/cad.png"/></img><br>    
</div>

The idea is that bamboo skewers will be placed in the holes, and the force of the bags will be distributed across them. By putting them at an angle, we have many bags in a smaller footprint.
