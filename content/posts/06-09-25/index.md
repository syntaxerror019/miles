This week, I spent most of shop time working with the golf cart. The new battery arrived so we put it in place, and we gave it a quick test-drive even though not all batteries were balanced yet. We finally charged all batteries and got them to each be within 0.2 volts of each other which will allow us to connect the equalizer modules. Hopefully this will prevent us from ruining another 300 dollar lead acid battery!

Jonas and I ended up spending a day in shop cleaning up the golfcart's parking spot. We re-arranged the two immobile ones, and in order to clean underneath one of them, we had to tip it over (carefully) to clean out the old parts and leaves left underneath.

To tip it fully, we had 5 people help. This was mainly because it still had 6 lead acid batteries left inside. This made it extremely bottom heavy and hard to topple. Normally, we would have rolled it out of the way, but the e-brake was rusted on, making it impossible to push.

Thursday was also our annual fells-day at school. I went on the 6 mile hike (which ended up becoming 8 miles due to a detour)
We found a cool old mine-shaft with a hole left in the cap. It was full of water.
