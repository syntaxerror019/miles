    "I built OpenWebRX+ from source on my Raspberry Zero 2W in hopes of making a local, power efficient, compact, (portable?) web-sdr to share the local airwaves with my friends.",
    "It runs with a simple USB power adapter, but I plan on making it solar powered in the near future.",
    "The actual heavy-lifting is done my the famous RTL-SDR. It is capable of receiving a wide range of frequencies, and I have set up an appropriate list of ranges on the software to support almost any kind of usage.",

    "CountAPI.xyz is no longer with us unfortunately. I for one heavily relied on this API and it functionality in a great number of my programming projects. After some research, I found that there was no ideal alternative. Most cost more than I was willing to pay, so I set out to create my own. For free!",
    "countapi.mileshilliard.com is my attempt at a relative-replica of the OG countapi.xyz. By reading the documentation and formatting of how the interface and endpoints functioned, I recreated my own using a Redis databse and a Vercel serverless script. Although performance may not quite match the original countapi, the minor dip shouldn't be noticeable in everyday applications.",
    "I intend this API to be free indefinitely. If it gains any traction, I will most likely need to upgrade to a different redis database, but until then, enjoy!",
    "All documentation can be found on the homepage of the API (link below) and includes formatted examples to get you started in any programming language.",]

  title = "HAM Radio License"
  text = [
    "As of 11/23/2024, I am a registered HAM radio operator. This means I can use technology that nobody has even thought about since WWII.",
    "HAM radio is a dying art, and I beleive it should be revived. The whole concept of communication without internet or networks or cables is fascinating, and still very important. Although HAM radio is now no longer as common as it once was, it can still be a necessity for some. People still rely on it as a form of communication (and entertainment) in less urbanized areas, and more recently, it has had an impact on natural disaster relief.",
    "With growing interests in RF and the world of analog modes, I am learning about various technologies, both analog and digital, including CW (morse code), SSTV (slow-scan television), RTTY, et al.",

Instead of using the standard git clone command, we leverage the Git framework to ensure a standardized and efficient repository download process. Upon successfully obtaining the repository, our system offers invaluable support for building and configuring it through our integrated Dependency Manager (DM) and, most notably, our Entry Point Detection (EPD) feature.'",
    "Between mid 2022 and to late 2023, I helped develop and test the Microsoft Windows side of the software, to ensure compatible and reliable usage across platforms.",
    "Much of the updating software was rewritten to be more efficient and documented during this time, making it easier for future development and overall user experience."

    "As a side-mission, WordBot was developed to be run efficiently on SBCs that can be easily powered strictly from solar energy by utilizing three 100W solar panels. With this, WordBot was the first carbon-neutral bot to be hosted with JKLM.FUN infrastructure.",

  text = [
    "As a fun project, I decided to create a simple algorithm to calculate any amount of pi to the Nth digit. By running this script on a small VPS for multiple weeks, many digits of Pi were generated and recorded. Initially with over 5 million digits of pi calculated, the calculations were saved. Due to an unforeseen file corruption error, only 3 million digits were saved properly. By this time, I decided to end the project here.",
    "During the calculation process, anybody could watch the digits being generated live by viewing the dedicated website. At this point, it serves as an archive and reference point for the 3 million digits of pi.",
    "Downloadable versions of one, two, and three million digits are available on GitHub and on the website."
